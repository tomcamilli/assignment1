To run the program, please have the data sets you will test in the "src" folder with my program. When you are ready to run it, enter "ruby assignment1.rb" in the terminal while in the "src" directory". The program will walk you through the process of entering filenames and booking rooms for the TCNJ Hackathon.

Known bugs/limitations:
-The "events.csv" file created by my program is not ordered in any way and this should be added in the future.
-You can book the same room multiple times, which was a hard-to-solve problem because of the way I was returning the list of events and not the list of schedule objects. I did not have time to fix this issue.
-Needed to test with more data.
